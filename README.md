# Healthcare-MURA-Data-Classification
## Introduction
MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs) is a large dataset of bone X-rays. 
Algorithms are tasked with determining whether an X-ray study is normal or abnormal. 
Musculoskeletal conditions affect more than 1.7 billion people worldwide, and are the most common cause of severe, long-term pain and disability, with 30 million emergency department visits annually and increasing.
Musculoskeletal radiograph is a large dataset of bone X-rays. 
## Problem Statement
To determine if the given bone X-ray is normal or abnormal. 
The upper extremity radiographic study consists of the following types 
- Elbows
- Shoulder
- Wrist.
## About the dataset
The dataset consists of 3.13 GB of X-ray images which was manually studied and labelled by the certified radiologist from the Stanford Hospital between 2001 and 2012. 
This dataset consists of 14863 studies from 12173 patients with total 40561 multi-view radiographic images.
The labeling was performed during interpretation on DICOM images presented on at least 3 megapixel PACS medical grade display with max luminance 400 cd/m2and min luminance 1 cd/m2 with pixel size of 0.2 and native resolution of 1500 x 2000 pixels.
## ML models used in this classification is 
- custom CNN model
- VGG-19
- VGG-16
- Inseption V3
## Conclusion
The MURA dataset is a large dataset of bone X-rays that has been used to train and evaluate models for detecting abnormalities in bones. The dataset includes over 40,000 images of bones from the upper and lower extremities, such as the wrist, elbow, and shoulder.

Several studies have used deep learning algorithms, such as CNN to train models on the MURA dataset and evaluate their performance in detecting abnormalities. These studies have shown promising results, with some models achieving high accuracy in detecting abnormalities.

In conclusion, the use of deep learning models trained on the MURA dataset has shown promising results in detecting abnormalities in bones. These models have the potential to assist radiologists in identifying abnormalities in bone X-rays, and ultimately lead to better outcomes for patients.
